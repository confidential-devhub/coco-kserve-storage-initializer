# coco-kserve-storage-initializer

Simply runs the kserve-storage-initializer, and then depending on the model and the env variables, decrypt the model and put it in the expected location.

Tested on `fraud-detection` and also `generative AI` example (download a model from hugging faces and run it in TGIS serving runtime).
